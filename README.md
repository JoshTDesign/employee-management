## Features  

*** 

This program can keep track of employees, roles, departments. Each of these objects also have associated attributes such as salary, management structure, and more. Employees and roles can be created and deleted. Roles can be changed and more.

### Challenges encountered  
This project really was a great introduction into using mySql databases to track and store information. Create reports by joining tables and more. Getting javascript to interact with mySql through Express was difficult at first, but I certainly learned a lot.


### Where credit is due  
This program uses npm packages 'Inquirer' and 'mySql' to create an interface between command-line and database.

### How to contribute  
To contribute to this program, you can fork this repository and expand the capabilities if you would like.
